<h2><u>What is Jenkins</u></h2>
<p>Jenkins is an open-source Continuous Integration server written in Java for orchestrating a chain of actions to achieve the Continuous Integration process in an automated fashion. Jenkins supports the complete development life cycle of software from building, testing, documenting the software, deploying, and other stages of the software development life cycle.</p>
<h3><u>What is Continuous Integration?</u></h3>
<p>Continuous Integration is a process of integrating code changes from multiple developers in a single project many times. The software is tested immediately after a code commit. With each code commit, code is built and tested. If the test is passed, the build is tested for deployment. If the deployment is successful, the code is pushed to production.

This commit, build, test, and deploy is a continuous process and hence the name continuous integration/deployment.</p>

<h4><u>How does Jenkins work?</u></h4>
<p>Jenkins is a server-based application and requires a web server like Apache Tomcat to run on various platforms like Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix, etc. To use Jenkins, you need to create pipelines which are a series of steps that a Jenkins server will take. Jenkins Continuous Integration Pipeline is a powerful instrument that consists of a set of tools designed to host, monitor, compile and test code, or code changes, like: <br>

=> Continuous Integration Server (Jenkins, Bamboo, CruiseControl, TeamCity, and others) <br>
=> Source Control Tool (e.g., CVS, SVN, GIT, Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase and others) <br>
=> Build tool (Make, ANT, Maven, Ivy, Gradle, and others) <br>
=> Automation testing framework (Selenium, Appium, TestComplete, UFT, and others)</p>
